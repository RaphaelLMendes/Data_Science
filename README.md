# Graduation Minor in Data Science by [Mauá Institute of Tecnology](https://maua.br/)

This repository houses some of the Data science project that I worked on during my minor graduation in data science. I loved working in each and every project in this repository. Feel free to have a look around and use code and data to enhance your studies as well!

## Graduation Description

The graduation of this Minor has the objective of presenting the grand areas of knowledge that involve Data Science. The course develops skills in Data Engineering, Data Analysis, Artificial Intelligence, Business Analytics, Big Data and data mining, being able to safely develop Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive and Prescriptive Analysis projects from start to finish, applying the best techniques currently available.

- [Machine Learning - Linear Regression applied to Beer Consumption](Jupiter_Notebooks\MachineLearning_DadosCerveja.ipynb)
  
        In this project I used a simple linear regression algorythm on beer consumption data in order to find insights that could lead to a competitive advantage in the beer production market.

- [Descriptive Análises of Financial/Investment dataset](Jupiter_Notebooks\Atividade_Dados_Investimento.ipynb)
  
        In this project I received some data on interest rate, dollar and other economic indicators. However, the data provider is apparently unreliable, due to a previous history of data problems and information leaks. Based on these points, I had to find inconsistencies in the data.
